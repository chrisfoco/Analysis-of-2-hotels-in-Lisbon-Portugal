# Analysis-of-2-hotels-in-Lisbon-Portugal

This is a look at 2 different hotels in Lisbon, Portugal.  The goal here is to practice data cleaning, mainpulation and vizualization.  It's also my first experience with machine learning outside of a learning enviornment.  Couple of notes:

 - this is not a finished notebook, but I wanted to upload it to (1) practice uploading to GIT and (2) to be transparent with my progress
  - I'm following along a project I found on Kaggle.  I don't have experience with all of the libraries presented here, but I understand the general thought process.
